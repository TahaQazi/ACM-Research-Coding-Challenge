# ACM Research Coding Challenge (Fall 2020)

## No Collaboration Policy

**You may not collaborate with anyone on this challenge.** You _are_ allowed to use Internet documentation. If you _do_ use existing code (either from Github, Stack Overflow, or other sources), **please cite your sources in the README**.
Used Code:
https://jakevdp.github.io/PythonDataScienceHandbook/05.11-k-means.html
https://towardsdatascience.com/k-means-clustering-algorithm-applications-evaluation-methods-and-drawbacks-aa03e644b48a
Used libraries:
matplotlib.pyplot
pandas
from sklearn.cluster I used Kmeans
from sklearn.preprocessing I used StandardScaler

## Question One

![Image of Cluster Plot](ClusterPlot.png)
<br/>
Given the following dataset in `ClusterPlot.csv`, determine the number of clusters by using any clustering algorithm. **You're allowed to use any Python library you want to implement this**, just document which ones you used in this README file. Try to complete this as soon as possible.

Regardless if you can or cannot answer the question, provide a short explanation of how you got your solution or how you think it can be solved in your README.md file.
Solution:
I looked up clutering techniques and found K-means as the easiest to use and implement for me. 
I used all the required libraries and estimated that there were about 3 clusters and at most 5 clusters, for efficiency.
I manually estimated the number of clusters.
